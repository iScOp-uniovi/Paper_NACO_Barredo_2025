# Results

## Raw data

There are two csv files:
- `energy_main_objectice.csv`: Contains the results from executing the experiment where the main objective is energy.
- `makespan_main_objectice.csv`: Contains the results from executing the experiment where the main objective is makespan.

### CSV Headers

- Execution: Unique identifier of the execution (each one consist of 10 independent runs)
- Algorithm: The fitness function used
- Workflow: The workflow to solve
- Hosts: The number of hosts used
- Best ENERGY: The minimum value of energy obtained in all runs
- Mean ENERGY: The mean value of energy obtained in that execution
- Min ENERGY: The minimum value of energy obtained in all runs
- Max ENERGY: The maximum value of energy obtained in all runs
- Best MAKESPAN: The minimum value of makespan obtained in all runs
- Mean MAKESPAN: The mean value of makespan obtained in that execution
- Min MAKESPAN:	The minimum value of makespan obtained in all runs
- Max MAKESPAN:	The maximum value of makespan obtained in all runs

## Calculated values and tables

To generate the tables in the paper we have used several pivot tables contained in the the excel document.
