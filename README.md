The growing energy consumption of cloud infrastructure has attained levels that
are no longer viable, necessitating the development of energy-aware scheduling
algorithms. This work focuses on optimising the scheduling of scientific workflows,
which require extensive computation to achieve time-efficient results, often at
the cost of excessive energy consumption. To address this challenge, a multi-
fitness evolutionary algorithm that integrates multiple heuristic functions in a
cooperative manner to minimise energy consumption is proposed. The approach
not only facilitates the reuse of heuristics but also provides novel insights into
the interplay between energy consumption and makespan, traditionally viewed as
conflicting objectives. This flexible framework demonstrates its adaptability for
optimising both total energy consumption and completion time, offering a robust
tool for sustainable workflow scheduling.
